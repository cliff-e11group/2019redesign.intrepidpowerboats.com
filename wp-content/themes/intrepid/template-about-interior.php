                        <p>Thanks to the distinct stepped hull design the CG (center of gravity) is positioned perfectly, producing an extraordinarily well-balanced ride. The boat takes off level and actually feels like you’re levitating onto plane. Waves are flattened, at any angle, with very little jolt transmitted. This makes for a smooth, dry ride, no lag and a noise factor that, to be honest, is really not a factor at all. The ride is quiet, allowing for normal conversation with an extra measure of comfort and pleasure for all aboard.</p>
