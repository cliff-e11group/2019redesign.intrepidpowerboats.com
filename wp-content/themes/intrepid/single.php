                            <p>I want to start this month’s newsletter off with a big thank you to everyone that came out to the Palm Beach Boat Show last month. It was the best Palm Beach Show that we have ever had. It actually exceeded the Miami Show for us. If you would have told me that a few years ago that the Palm Beach Show would top the Miami Show for new sales I would have told you that you were crazy. This show really has become quite the venue.</p>

                            <p>It probably did not hurt that we also debuted a boat there for the first time. The new 375 SE Nomad was a big hit. The entire Nomad series has really taken off and we are already prototyping the next in this series, the 407 FE and SE Nomad.</p>

                            <p>The other new boat that we are diligently working on is the new 345 Walkaround. We are creating the deck plug now and we have the mockups of the cabin that we are working on. It is one thing to draw it but we really need to go full mock up on new models so you can literally feel the space and the actual usability. More times than not what we draw and what we actually end up with are very different after the mockup stage. Here are some shots we took during mock up on the 345 Walkaround. We have already taken deposits on all three of these new models so if you want more information on any of these and want to get on the waiting list, <a href="#">please reach out to our Dania Sales office.</a></p>

                            <p>Another new project that we have started working on is our new video owner’s manuals. Our VP of Customer Service Joe Brenna has taken on this project and has one model finished and under his belt and that is the 407 Panacea. We have this on our YouTube channel now and we will be adding this tab to our website and our owner’s portal. You will see that it is indexed by subject matter so that you can go right to the section that you are most interested in. We plan on doing this for every model and also creating an app to access them as well. So, a big shout out to Joe and his partner in this project our VP of Engineering Richard Ahl for the extra time that these guys have put in and will continue to put in in order to get all of this information out to you for you to use. Good stuff!</p>

                            <p>Besides the Nomad Series boats the <a href="#">407 Cuddy</a> and <a href="#">Panacea</a> continue to sell well along with the <a href="#">327 Open</a>. The other model that seems to be on fire right now is the <a href="#">475 Sport Yacht</a>. The Sport Yacht line that we build these on usually splits build slots with <a href="#">475 Panaceas</a>, <a href="#">410 Evolutions</a>, and <a href="#">430 Sport yachts</a> but right now I have (5) <a href="#">475 Sport Yachts</a> lined up in a row! It is definitely the Sport Yacht of choice for this first part of 2019!!</p>
                            <p>The next show that we are attending is the Suncoast Boat Showstarting this Friday 4/26 and running through Sunday the 28th in Sarasota. We are bringing our latest model the <a href="#">375 SE Nomad</a>, a <a href="#">327 Center Console</a>, and the mighty <a href="#">200 flats boat</a>! Our own Mark Beaver and Alex Rizo will be there to answer everyone’s questions and show you our latest and greatest. We hope to see everyone down there!</p>

                            <p>Very happy to report that the Palm Beach Boat Show was a huge success and I would like to personally thank everyone that came by to see us. Besides having the time to visit with our existing customers, we also made many new friends with a great number of new boat orders. We’re already looking forward to being there again next year.</p>
                            <p>This was the first showing of the new 375 Nomad. It received amazing reviews from both our customers and the media that came to interview us and write several upcoming articles.</p>
                            <p>This month we're headed to the Suncoast Boat Show in Sarasota, Florida, April 26, 27, & 28 where we will have the 375 Nomad, 327I Center Console and our 200 Flats Boat on display. Mark Beaver, Barrett Grene and I will all be attending. We are very excited to be going to a West Coast of Florida boat show and seeing many of our friends and customers in this small venue setting which gives us even more time to spend together. With summer around the corner and the boat show season coming to an end please make your plans to visit with us.</p>
